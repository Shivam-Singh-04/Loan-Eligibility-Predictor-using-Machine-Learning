# Loan-Eligibility-Predictor-using-Machine-Learning

The objective was to predict whether a customer is eligible for a particular loan or not with the help on some criteria's such as Loan Amount, Dependents, Marital Status, Applicants Income, Loan Amount Term, etc. Here, Python was used since it's structure and syntax is easy for a beginner to understand and it provides various libraries which play a crucial role in Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization and Data Analytics.



The Libraries used in the project are:

● Pandas: Powerful, Fast and Flexible library for Data Analysis, manipulating and filtering.

● NumPy: Used to perform mathematical and logical operations on arrays.

● Matplotlib: Comprehensive library for creating static, interactive and animated visualizations.

● Scikit Learn: Most useful library with efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.



Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning algorithm where the machine is trained using labeled data (output is labeled with input) and predicts the output for unseen data. Here, we have use Decision Tree Classification and Naïve Bayes algorithm to compare the output accuracy. The accuracy for decision tree was found out to be 70% which is not good in terms of predicting and similarly for Naïve Bayes was 82% which was quite good for modeling. We can also apply SVM and Random Forest algorithm to check if we can get more accuracy.
